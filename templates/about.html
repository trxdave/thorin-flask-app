    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
		recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
		Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
		Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
		Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
		action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
		leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
			<p>
				In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
				Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
				2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
				Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
				point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
				the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin.
            
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the
                quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would
                come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing
                the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
            
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
            
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
                said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named
                Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may
                have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin,
                when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger
                brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and
                Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.
            
                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
                Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was
                captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a
                fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

            <p>
                Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In
                the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the
                other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other
                Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of
                Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

                shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in
                the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

                out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf
                warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he
                continued his life as a toy maker.

                although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
                between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years,"
                and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA
                2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the
                Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

            <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
            <p>
                Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890
                of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took.
            
                In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole for Belladonna, which they named Bag
                End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.
            
                As a young Hobbit, Bilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, Gandalf, took
                interest in this unusual quality in Bilbo during his visits to the Shire. Bilbo would later remember Gandalf's
                fireworks in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. Bilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing
                skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.
            
                When Bilbo's father and mother died in TA 2926 and TA 2934 respectively, Bilbo became his own master and spent the
                next seven years living alone in Bag End. During this time, Bilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and
                acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.

            <h3>Gandalf</h3>
            <p>
                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music
                of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he became
                one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like
                Varda, yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but
                walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them
                wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of
                Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.
